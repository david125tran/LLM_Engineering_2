**Campaign Concept: "Step Into Tomorrow"**

**Core Idea:** Launch an immersive digital experience that highlights the journey of our sustainable shoes from eco-friendly materials to production, integrating augmented reality (AR) to let customers virtually try on the shoes while learning about their environmental impact.

**Target Audience:** Eco-conscious consumers aged 18-35 who prioritize sustainability in fashion and are active on social media.

**Primary Channels:** Instagram and TikTok for engaging AR filters and short-form videos; a dedicated microsite for the interactive experience; influencer partnerships for authentic storytelling.

**KPIs:** Track engagement rates (likes, shares, and comments) on social media, and measure conversion rates via the microsite to assess the effectiveness of the AR experience.

Okay, "Step Into Tomorrow" is a good start. I like the focus on digital immersion and AR.

**Refinement:** Let's amplify the "future" aspect. The core idea should lean more into innovation and less on just sustainability.

**Revised Core Idea:** Position our shoes as a glimpse into the future of footwear – where style, sustainability, and technology converge. The campaign will showcase the innovative materials and production processes, emphasizing the shoes' futuristic design and performance benefits alongside their eco-friendly nature.

**Action for the Marketer:** Research and propose 3-5 specific AR filter concepts that showcase the "future" aspects of the shoe (e.g., visualizing the recycled materials transforming into the shoe, displaying performance metrics in AR overlay). Also, identify 3-5 influencers who align with both sustainability and tech/futuristic aesthetics.

**AR Filter Concepts:**

1. **Material Transformation Filter:** Users can see a visual transformation of recycled materials (like plastic bottles and discarded fabrics) morphing into the shoe design. This filter would allow users to swipe through different materials to see their journey to becoming footwear.

2. **Futuristic Performance Metrics:** An AR overlay that activates when a user points their camera at their feet while wearing our shoes. It would display dynamic performance metrics, such as energy return, cushioning levels, and eco-impact stats in real-time, enhancing the futuristic feel.

3. **Sustainability Footprint Visualizer:** This filter would show a user's environmental impact score based on their activities while wearing our shoes. It could gamify the experience, rewarding users for eco-friendly actions (walking, recycling, etc.) with badges displayed in AR.

4. **Style Customization Experience:** Users can virtually customize their shoes in AR, changing colors, patterns, and materials while visualizing the eco-friendly options. They can then share their personalized designs on social media.

5. **Future City Walk:** An AR filter that places users in a futuristic cityscape as they walk in our shoes, highlighting how eco-friendly footwear contributes to a sustainable future. Users can interact with elements in the city that depict a greener world.

**Influencer Suggestions:**

1. **Kristen Leo (@kristenleo):** A sustainability advocate with a focus on ethical fashion and eco-friendly products, aligning perfectly with our brand's ethos.

2. **Mikayla Nogueira (@mikaylanogueira):** A beauty influencer with a tech-savvy audience, she often incorporates innovative products into her content and has a strong following.

3. **Sophie Turner (@sophiet):** Known for her fashion-forward style and advocacy for sustainability, she bridges the gap between celebrity influence and eco-consciousness.

4. **Kara and Nate (@karaandnate):** Travel vloggers who focus on sustainable travel practices, appealing to an audience that values innovation in both fashion and lifestyle.

5. **Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD):** A tech influencer recognized for his reviews of innovative products and sustainable technologies, ideal for highlighting the tech aspects of our shoes.
